# Snake Game in Python

This Python Snake game is a classic implementation of the popular Snake game using the Turtle graphics library. It's built with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and includes features like inheritance to create a clean and extensible codebase.

## Game Overview

The Snake Game is a simple yet addictive game where the player controls a snake on the screen. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. As the snake eats food, it grows longer, making the game progressively more challenging.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naitik2314/Snake-Game.git
   cd Snake-Game

2. **Run the game**

   ```bash
   python3 main.py #For Linux/Mac
   python main.py #For windows

Make sure you have Python3.x installed on your system.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
- Try to eat the food that appears on the screen to grow longer.
- Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
- The game ends when the snake crashes into a wall or itself.

## Features

- Object-Oriented Design: The game is built using OOP principles to keep the code modular and maintainable.
- Inheritance: Inheritance is used to create specialized game objects, such as the Snake and Food.
- Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score.
- Game Over Screen: When the game ends, a game over screen is displayed with the player's score.
- Responsive Controls: The snake's movement responds to arrow key input from the player.
- Colorful Graphics: Turtle graphics library is used to create a visually appealing game.
