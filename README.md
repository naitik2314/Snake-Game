Game Overview
The Snake Game is a simple yet addictive game where the player controls a snake on the screen. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. As the snake eats food, it grows longer, making the game progressively more challenging.

Installation

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git
cd snake-game
Run the Game:

How to Play
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.

Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
The game ends when the snake crashes into a wall or itself.
